<h1>
Neural network stb library
</h1>

<a>This project was inspired by Tsoding's ML series. Although I watched it was inspired of Tsoding's videos, most parts of code are written by my own.

<h3>
How this library works:
</h3>

<a>
The code has 3 parts. Math, basic ml, and automation parts. Of course I will work on this project, and will add more new features.

Math part contains matrix structure and functions related to linear algebra and calculus (I plan to add vectors and etc.). 

Basic ml part contains functions for creating neural network model and training it with dataset.

Automation part contains functions for automating some processes. For example, auto model and dataset creation functions.
